    <p> My main goal for this course is to help me learn more about computer science and to see if this is going to be a good career path for me. I had been struggling with continuing my journey with nursing school and starting over with IT classes. Ultimately, I decided to start over and change my major to computer science. I think that changing career paths is going to allow me to have more time with my family and be able to find a job that I can work remotely.

      I have always enjoyed learning how to fix things and figuring out shortcuts to help me work more efficiently. At my current job Im one of the people that my coworkers can go to for simple IT fixes on their computers if our IT guy is not available. I have learned that I enjoy being able to find a fix and seeing the relief on someones face once they see their problem is fixed. I look forward to learning more and being able to use all of the things that I learn in real life.

        <li>Baking - I recently started picking up baking more seriously and have been making a lot of homemade cinnamon rolls and fresh bread! Being able to bake something from sractch makes me feel better knowing I can make my family homemade goods. The stores have been cleared out of bread for the winter storm but we didnt have to worry about trying to find any since I can make a few loaves for them to eat.</li>
        <li>Crotcheting - My grandma taught me how to crotchet and it always brings back good memories for me. Although I am not good at it, I still enjoy starting new projects!</li>
        <li>Reading - I set a goal every year to read as many books as I think is possible for myself. Last year I read 100 books but this year I have only set a goal of 50 books since I will be in school full time now</li>
