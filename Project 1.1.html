    <p>
        My main goal for this course is to help me learn more about computer science and to see if this is going to be a good career path for me...
    </p>

    <p>
        I have always enjoyed learning how to fix things and figuring out shortcuts...
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Baking - I recently started picking up baking more seriously...</li>
        <li>Crocheting - My grandma taught me how to crochet...</li>
        <li>Reading - I set a goal every year to read as many books...</li>
    </ul>
